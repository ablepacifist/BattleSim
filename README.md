# BattleSim
Used for D&D but may expand beyond. Meant to simulate large scale battle between two armies. Two teams filled with different types of soldiers that take turns fighting and dealing damage. 
each "square" is 50 feet. As opposed to 5 ft spaces in D&D. health is based on how many troops are in the unit out of 10k. 10k is max unit size.
turn order is determined from movement speed which is determined by speed which changes based on exhaustion

exhaustion changes:
attack -.1
move -how much of move is used

Each unit has:
exhaustion
battle damage
movement speed
health

Unit types:
swordman
archer
spearmen
catipult(coming soon)
cavalry(coming soon)

things to add:
get army layout from text file
some sort of GUI or battle area
